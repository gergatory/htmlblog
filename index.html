         About me.
     </h1>
     <p>
        Thank you for taking <span>time</span> to read my blog and seeing a slice of my coding journey. <br>
        I am a graduate of Business Management and French, I chose to learn French as I enjoy communicating with others and learning about culture different to my own.

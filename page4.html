              <p>  Thank you for taking time to read my blog and seeing a slice of my coding journey.</p>

            <p>I am a graduate of Business Management and French from the University of Manchester, I chose to learn French as I enjoy communicating with others and learning about culture that is different to my own.</p>

                <p>As part of my studies, I spent a year abroad in France in 2018; the year was split between working in an accountancy department for a hospitality company. My passion for the mountains was forged in the French Alps - there is something about the untameable beauty of the mountains that makes me want to return.</p> <p>After my stint working in the Savoie region I then rejoined some of my coursemates in Lyon where I studied for a semester at Jean-Moulin Universite Lyon 3. The cuisine here was phenomenal and the Lyonnais inhabitants are incredibly friendly and I made the most of my time there by watching the Olympique Lyonnais football team, sunbathing in the park with friends, and going to the local bars and hiking up to the amphitheatre.</p>

                    <p>   My reasoning for taking a course in coding was to learn a new skill prior to starting my master's in Management at the London School of Economics. I follow some mentors on Twitter and they stressed the importance of learning to code in the digital era. I see coding as digital architecture, enabling users to construct writing lines of code.

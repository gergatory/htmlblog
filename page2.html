<h2>
        2.1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page. 
</h2>
<p>
        I decided to go for a simplistic layout in order to allow for easy navigation. The textboxes break up each section nicely and the occasional image helps to reinforce the points covered in the body of text. The Home screen covers a brief summary and then the Unit 2 covers the rest of the content. The ‘About Me’ section is more personalised, it summarises my experience at University and my reasoning for taking this Code Nation course. Moreover, I opted to include a link to my LinkedIn and email for a more professional approach.

        2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites. 
</h2>
<p>
        Copyright protects intangible intellectual property (IP); it is separate from the physical work with which it is associated. In addition to art, you cannot legally duplicate many other common household items, including computer software, movies, and music recordings, without the copyright holder's permission. Posting copyrighted works on file-sharing programs is not only a copyright infringement, it is a crime under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 [link]. Thus developers must be aware of content that is already on the web so as to not infringe on copyright.

        2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.
</h2>
<p>
        Using a computer is still something many disabled people struggle with. According to the Office for National Statistics, in May 2015, 27% of disabled adults had never used the internet, compared to 11% of non-disabled adults. In 2013, Ofcom said that factors beyond age and income, possibly related to the individual’s disability, contribute to limited internet access [link]. People with disabilities can use Siri features or Voice Over to access the web.

            2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites. 
    </h2>
    <p>
            <b>HTML</b> - Was used to initially write all the content intended for the website; such as, adding photos, textboxes, then text. Create links to different pages, for instance, I display three tabs on my site which covet the course content and also my background.  
    </p>
    <p>
            <b>CSS</b> - was used to edit the content on the website, such as alignment and image editing to ensure that the text was visible and that the images integrated well with the site - by making some images transparent the sit flowed better and had a more artistic element.
